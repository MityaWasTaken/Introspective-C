# Introspecive-C
introspective C is a compiled programming language that I wrote. a lot of it is introspective and that's why it's called Introspective C. It is a little hard to compile, because that too, is introspetive... again, hence the name introspective-C.. Despite the name, it has nothing to do with C besides the fact that I wrote it in C

# quick note
yes, I am aware of unsupported character output. and I am working very hard to fix the issue

# How to compile 
(1. download the compiler directory to your machine, with the C code in it and everything
(2. create a directory called config and make a file called compiler.cnf.
(3. inside compiler.cnf, write the reletive or absolute path of the Introspective-C file you wish to compile
(4. then make your Introspective-C file and go to town
(5. compile the compiler.c file, and in turn, that should generate a binary of your Intropective-C code... If you don't want to compile it yourself, you can just use the makefile that is provided in the repo

commands:
    ping_home   |   pings local host
    ("FFF")     |   prints text between quote symbols


# important notes
language does not yet have a main function 
language does not yet have any commands except for ping_home and the string_print ability by doing ("this is a string")
LANGUAGE DOES NOT REQUIRE SEMICOLONS
it is tab sensitive
it is case sensitive
this languge can only run 1 command at a time at the moment currently
