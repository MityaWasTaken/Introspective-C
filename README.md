# Introspecive-C
introspective C is a compiled programming language that I wrote. a lot of it is introspective and that's why it's called Introspective C. It is a little hard to compile, because that too, is introspetive... again, hence the name introspective-C.. Despite the name, it has nothing to do with C besides the fact that I wrote it in C

# quick notes
the terminal version is much better, and less buggy than the file version. The terminal version is recommended to be used over the file version because the compilation method is more like an interpretation method, and that is much more ideal. This program indexes specific parts of the string.. That makes the file version much more buggy since there is a lot more leway in terms of moving spaces and stuff like that. So please use the terminal version, even though the file version also works... Also there is one other command in the terminal version that might soon be also moved to the file version. Look at the documentation below in order to understan what I'm saying.

# How to compile 
(1. download the compiler directory to your machine, with the C code in it and everything
(2. create a directory called config and make a file called compiler.cnf.
(3. inside compiler.cnf, write the reletive or absolute path of the Introspective-C file you wish to compile
(4. then make your Introspective-C file and go to town
(5. compile the compiler.c file, and in turn, that should generate a binary of your Intropective-C code... If you don't want to compile it yourself, you can just use the makefile that is provided in the repo

 <h3>file command:</h3> 
    <li>("some text")  | outputs some text</li>

 <h3>file command:</h3>

    <li>("some text")  | outputs some text</li>
    <li>[mkdir directory] | anything inside of the brackets gets executed as a bash command</li>
